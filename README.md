# gatbx-sheffield-example
This is a simple example for learning Genetic Algorithm using the gatbx Toolbox by Sheffield.
It solves the problem of De Jong's first test function.
Again, it is trivial. The objective function is even tranferred from the Toolbox.
However, it is good to familiarise with the structure of Genetic Algorithm.
